# Pseudo 3D Portal Renderer

Rendering is of the Doom/Duke Nuke 3D era in that it:
- is rendered in software
- with perspective correct texture mapping
- using almost entirely 2D mathematics
- no depth buffer
- relying on portals to solve visibility

Still lacking:
- concave sectors
- robust sprite clipping
- collision detection/resolution
- wall/floor decals
- portal textures (middle part)
- parallax texture mapping
- animation
- audio
- UI
